# ⌨  Input Overlay Wayland 

Basically this is a fork of OSKD an on-screen keyboard display that can be used during streams. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that can help viewers keep track of the keyboard inputs used during the stream.

I'm using it as alternative to [Input Overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay) that doesn't work on Wayland.
